### What is this repository for? ###

The goal of this project is to implement a web site to allow end users easy access to the SOAP-based Web service created in part 3. We use Java servlets, JSP, and Javascript to build the web site and AJAX to access the remote Web services. We also integrate Google Suggest and Google Map.

### How do I get set up? ###

Run two commands to build and deploy the project:
`ant build`
`ant deploy`

### Other Info ###
The javascript implementation of the dropdown for Google Suggest was done without using any javascript libraries. The styling of the dropdown is done with Bootstrap classes.
